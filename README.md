## Archive

- If passed the `--archive [path]` option, `podcast-dl` will generate/use a JSON archive at the provided path.
- Before downloading an episode or writing out metadata, it'll check if the item was saved previously and abort the save if found.

## Template Options

Options that support templates allow users to specify a template for the generated filename(s) or option. The provided template will replace all matched keywords with the related data described below. Each keyword must be wrapped in two braces like so:

`--out-dir "./{{podcast_title}}"`

`--episode-template "{{release_date}}-{{title}}"`

### `--out-dir` & `--archive`

- `podcast_title`: Title of the podcast feed.
- `podcast_link`: `link` value provided for the podcast feed. Typically the homepage URL.

### `--episode-template`

- `title`: The title of the episode.
- `release_date`: The release date of the episode in `YYYYMMDD` format.
- `episode_num`: The location number of where the episodes appears in the feed.
- `url`: URL of episode audio file.
- `duration`: Provided `mm:ss` duration (if found).
- `podcast_title`: Title of the podcast feed.
- `podcast_link`: `link` value provided for the podcast feed. Typically the homepage URL.
- `guid`: The GUID of the episode.

#### `--episode-custom-template-options`

Each matcher provided will be used to extract a value from the episode `title`. Access these values in the template using the `custom_<n>` keyword where `<n>` is the index of the matcher provided (starting from `0`).

If no match is found, the `custom_<n>` keyword will be replaced with an empty string.

### `--exec`

- `episode_path`: The path to the downloaded episode.
- `episode_path_base`: The path to the folder of the downloaded episode.
- `episode_filename`: The filename of the episode.
- `episode_filename_base`: The filename of the episode without its extension.

## Log Levels

By default, all logs and errors are outputted to the console. The amount of logs can be controlled using the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` with the following options:

- `static`: All logs and errors are outputted to the console, but disables any animations.
- `quiet`: Only important info and non-critical errors will be logged (e.g. episode download started).
- `silent`: Only critical error messages will be be logged.

## OS Filename Limits

By default, the max length of a generated filename is `255`. If your OS has different limitations, or if you're running into issues with non-standard feeds, you can adjust the limit via the environment variable `MAX_LENGTH_FILENAME`.
